    Inventory management is a discipline primarily about specifying the 
        shape and placement of stocked goods. It is required at different locations
        within a facility or within many locations of a supply network to
        precede the regular and planned course of production and stock of materials.

        
       
The concept of inventory, stock or work-in-process has been extended from 
manufacturing systems to service businesses and projects,
by generalizing the definition to be "all work within the process of production- all work that 
is or has occurred prior to the completion of production." 
In the context of a manufacturing production system, inventory refers to all 
work that has occurred ? raw materials, partially finished products, finished
products prior to sale and departure from the manufacturing system. 
In the context of services, inventory refers to all work done prior to sale,
including partially process information.  Inventory Management System is a software application which fulfills the requirement of a typical Stock Analysis in various go downs. It provides the interface to users in a graphical way to manage the daily transactions as well as historical data. Also provides the management reports like order placed, deliveries and products available. 
      The system provides information to efficiently manage the flow of materials, effectively utilize people and equipment, coordinate internal activities and communicate with customers. Inventory Management does not make decisions or manage operations, they provide the information to managers who make more accurate and timely decisions to manage their operations.
This application maintains the centralized database so that any changes done at a location reflects immediately. This is an online tool so more than one user can login into system and use the tool simultaneously. Authentication is provided to the logged in user.
The aim of this application is to reduce the manual effort needed to manage transactions and historical data used in various go downs. Also, this application provides an interface to users to view the details like the daily Stock Statements of all go downs.
